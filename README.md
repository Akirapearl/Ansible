### base directory
1. Current
- First playbook
- Installing software to Rocky/RHEL based linux server/VM
- Starting Services
- Hardening SSH access by disabling password authentication

2. To-be-added ideas
- Put cronjobs in place
- Execute commands or scripts on remote machine and report to ansible's output (i.e netstat, lsblk, df-h, uptime)
- Check server system activity reports and stats. [1]
- Work with conditionals
