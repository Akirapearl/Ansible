### base directory
1. Current
- First playbooks
- Installing software to Rocky/RHEL based linux
- Starting Services

2. To-be-added ideas
- Put cronjobs in place
- Put configurations in-place for specific services (i.e configure apache to listen on port 8080 instead of 80) [1]
- Execute commands or scripts on remote machine and report to ansible's output (i.e netstat, lsblk, df-h, uptime)
